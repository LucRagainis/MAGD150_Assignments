### Assignment 8

This assignment was to practice text and the ability to print to a PDF file. The theme was "movie posters."

I created a randomly generated movie title, drawn from a simple text list of possibilities, with a simple poster background. The poster can be regenrated by mouse click, and the poster can be saved to a PDF file.
